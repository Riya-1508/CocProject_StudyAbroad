As you progress through each semester and successfully pass the examinations, you will receive credit for the units you have successfully completed. Therefore, throughout your programme of study you will have a clear indication of your academic progress.Each of the chemistry course units in the first two years has two lectures, and an associated small group workshop or problem class per week. Students are also grouped into small tutorial groups of about five people and meet their tutors once a week for an hour to discuss Details and problems from the course.In addition to these contact hours, you will be expected to engage in independent learning, including reading, preparation, coursework and revision. Each standard unit (6 credits) has a notional learning time commitment of 120 hours, including both contact hours and independent learning. This is consistent with national guidelines.The nature of our courses and the calibre of our graduates ensure that they enjoy an excellent employment rate in industry, scientific, administration, teaching, Research Councils and the Civil Service. Many students are employed in research and development. Others find employment in allied areas such as marketing, administration, production and technical services.

To understand how and why an individual engages in any given behavior, one must have an understanding of several factors. For example, the biological basis of behavior is studied to understand how the central nervous system, the endocrine system, and genetic influences all interact to yield observable behavior.Psychologists analyze the cognitive and perceptual systems at a somewhat more abstract level in order to characterize the internal representations and processes that underlie perception, thought, and action. The personality of the individual how that individual differs from others is also an important determinant of behavior.Social psychology is the study of how individuals behave in a social context, where virtually all behavior takes place. Because living organisms change over time, the development of physiological, perceptual, cognitive, personality, and social factors can also help explain behavior in humans and animals.",
